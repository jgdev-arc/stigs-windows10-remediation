# üõ°Ô∏è Windows 10 STIG Remediation Scripts

A curated collection of PowerShell scripts that implement **Windows 10 Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)** remediations published by DISA. Each script targets a specific STIG ID, hardens the system according to DoD cybersecurity standards, and includes inline documentation for clarity and auditing.

> ‚öôÔ∏è Built to assist system administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and compliance teams in automating secure baseline enforcement across Windows 10 environments.

## üìå What Is This Repository?

This project contains standalone PowerShell scripts that:

- Enforce **DISA STIG** policies on Windows 10 systems
- Address specific findings from vulnerability assessments (e.g., SCAP scans)
- Include **documentation**, **script logic**, and **expected outcomes**
- Are version-controlled and auditable for use in production or lab hardening efforts

Each script targets one STIG ID and can be executed independently or grouped into remediation pipelines.

## üß† Why This Matters

Implementing DISA STIGs is essential for:

- Reducing the attack surface
- Complying with DoD cybersecurity policies
- Enforcing secure configuration baselines in enterprise environments

This project helps **automate that process** using **PowerShell** and is suitable for use in:

- Security hardening workflows  
- Audit readiness checks  
- Cybersecurity portfolios  
- DevSecOps pipelines

## üöÄ Usage

Each script is self-contained and can be executed directly in PowerShell (with administrator privileges).  
Scripts are named for traceability and mapped to their respective STIG IDs.

Example:
```powershell
.\V-220711-disable-basic-auth-wdigest.ps1
